# Learning OpenTelemetry

- Goal:  
  - to learn how to use OpenTelemetry and become a contributor to the project.

OpenTelemetry is a complex project that is carefully thought.It is engineered from developers with years of experience that have faced many hardships through trials an errors. I want to be apart of this community and therefore need to learn how to write quality code. In order to write quality code I need to be able to understand the objectives of OpenTelemetry at a high level. In addition, I need to have strong fundamentals skills so I can easily read and understand what the code base is doing. To achieve my goal, I need to learn quickly which is why I am taking 2 different perspectives, a bottom-up and top-down approach.

### Bottom-up approach

A bottom-up approach has the goal of starting small and building up. This means to create small components that I think are necessary for creating a naive telemetry / collector system. The goal is to have bare minimum features with specific instances. This will help server as a guide to learning relevant skills to contribute to the code base.

The **bottom-up** cycle
    - identify core components within OTLP
    - break up the problem
    - understand the problem it is solving
    - slowly build up in a naive telemetry / collector system

### Top-down approach

A top-up view has the goal of starting from working on the system and breaking pieces up.

The **top-down** cycle
    - read the documentation
    - run demos
    - tweak perimeters to understand relationships
    - inspect surface level code + i depth as needed

### Lesson Plan for bottom-down naive telemetry/ collector

Each section will contain their own folder.

- what is an application (client/ server)
  - how can you connect services
- What is context
  - how can context create timeouts, and a trace
- What is yaml
  - how to pass configuration details using yaml
- What is docker
  - how can you containerize a service
- What is docker-compose
  - how can you containerize multiple services
